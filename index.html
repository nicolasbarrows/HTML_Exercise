      <p>
        Nicolas is a full stack web developer with an eye for design and a
        passion for implementing sites that are aesthetic, intuitive & useful.
        When he isn't designing, he can be found with his wife, Portia,
        his dogs Kevin & Russell, & his bearded dragon Eustace--likely talking
        them into yet another home project.

      <p>
        I looked down at the board. "The <strong>point</strong> isn't to win?" I asked. "The
        point," <span>Bredon</span> said grandly, "is to <u>play</u> a <em>beautiful</em> game." He lifted
        his hands and shrugged, his face breaking into a beautific smile. "Why
        would I want to win anything other than a <em>beautiful</em> game?"
